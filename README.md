# Cloud Seeker

Welcome to the Cloudseeker, a simple and intuitive weather application developed using React and Tailwind CSS. This app fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API and presents it in a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The Weather App has two main features: automatic location detection and search-based weather forecasts.
